# -------------- Binary to Decimal Converter --------------

This is a program to convert binary number to its decimal value.
User should not input more than 8 digits or we can say 8 digits.
When you input more than 8 it doesn't calculate.
Also you should not input a string. Because infinite loop occurs when you do it.
So keep theese in mind.
