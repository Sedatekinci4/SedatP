This program calculates the distance between two cities by their latitude and longitude.

The function that i've used in this program is taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928/calculate-distance-between-two-latitude-longitude-points-haversine-formula

Also you can find the information about the calculation formula via: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula

I used information of Ankara and Konya which are two cities from Turkey. You can find information about these cities via:
