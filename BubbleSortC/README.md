# Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of n elements provided in form of an array with n number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values.

Implementing Bubble Sort Algorithm
Following are the steps involved in bubble sort(for sorting a given array in ascending order):

 1) Starting with the first element(index = 0), compare the current element with the next element of the array.
 2) If the current element is greater than the next element of the array, swap them. 
 3) If the current element is less than the next element, move to the next element. Repeat Step 1.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```diff
Please Enter the number of elements for your array:      5
Please Enter the Value of the elements:          -5
7
15
87
