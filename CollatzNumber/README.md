# Collatz conjecture

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. 

The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.

It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 

if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 

The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.

This program performs the operations and let you see that you always end up on 1.
